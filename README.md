# Experiment 4: Single Server with infinite Capacity (M/M/1):(∞/FIFO)
# Aim:
To find
(a) Average number of materials in the system
(b) Average number of materials in the conveyor
(c) Waiting time of each material in the system
(d) Waiting time of each material in the conveyor
If the arrival of materials follow poisson process with mean interval time 12 seconds, service
time of lathe machine follows exponential distribution with mean service time 1 second and
average service time of robot is 7 seconds.
# Software Required: 
Visual Components and Python
# Theory:
1. The model has one server and unlimited queue space, so any number of customers
can wait without blocking new arrivals.
2. Arrivals usually follow a Poisson process, and service times come from a chosen
probability distribution, often exponential in the classic M/M/1 case.
3. The system reaches a stable steady state only when the service rate exceeds the
arrival rate; otherwise the queue grows without bound.
4. Key performance measures—like average waiting time, average queue length, and
server utilization—emerge from the balance between these two rates.
5. Despite its simplicity, the model serves as a foundational benchmark for analysing
more intricate queueing systems and real-world service operations.
